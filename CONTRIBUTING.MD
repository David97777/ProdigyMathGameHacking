# Citizen Code of Conduct

## Purpose (This doesn't have anything to do with our hacking standards)

We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored *all* of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. Therefore, we have created this Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct

### Under NO circumstances should ANYBODY use these hacks to circumvent the privacy of other users, use explicits within the game, phish, gain access to other accounts without autorization from the original account user, or otherwise go against our purpose.

#### You must not use **any** of the hacks to achieve personal benefit, including but not limited to:
- Real-life currencies
- For the sole purpose of social media followers or other statistics, including but not limited to YouTube viewers, Twitter likes/reposts, and social media followers. **You may make a YouTube video, Twitter post, or other social media post of our hacks if, and only if, you provide credit, state our purpose, link our code of conduct, and link this repository. Do *not* show these hacks without giving a clear method to obtain them. If you are making a YouTube video, follow this format: https://github.com/Prodigy-Hacking/ProdigyMathGameHacking/blob/master/videocredit.md**

#### FAILING TO FOLLOW OUR TERMS WILL RESULT IN LEGAL ACTION

### Goal
We are not trying to ruin Prodigy Math Game; we want to fix it. However, Prodigy has ignored *all* of our security reports, and has gone as far as to block a user from their Zendesk support center, simply because they reported hacks. We have come to a conclusion that to make Prodigy fix the issues with their game, we have to practically throw it into their face. Please don't make contributions attempting to create hacks that will harm the game, or otherwise not follow our goals/code of conduct.
